                  <strong>Title:</strong> Multimodal Image Super-resolution via Joint Sparse Representations induced by
                  Coupled Dictionaries<br>

                  D.

                  <strong>Journal/Conference:</strong> IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging<br>
                  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Real-world data processing problems often involve various image
                    modalities associated with a certain scene, including RGB images, infrared images or multi-spectral
                    images. The fact that different image modalities often share certain attributes, such as edges,
                    textures and other structure primitives, represents an opportunity to enhance various image
                    processing
                    tasks. This paper proposes a new approach to construct a high-resolution (HR) version of a
                    low-resolution (LR) image given another HR image modality as guidance, based on joint sparse
                    representations induced by coupled dictionaries. The proposed approach captures complex dependency
                    correlations, including similarities and disparities, between different image modalities in a
                    learned
                    sparse feature domain in lieu of the original image domain. It consists of two phases: coupled
                    dictionary learning phase and coupled super-resolution phase. The learning phase learns a set of
                    dictionaries from the training dataset to couple different image modalities together in the sparse
                    feature domain. In turn, the super-resolution phase leverages such dictionaries to construct a HR
                    version of the LR target image with another related image modality for guidance. In the advanced
                    version of our approach, multi-stage strategy and neighbourhood regression concept are introduced to
                    further improve the model capacity and performance. Extensive guided image super-resolution
                    experiments on real multimodal images demonstrate that the proposed approach admits distinctive
                    advantages with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches, for example, overcoming the texture
                    copying artifacts commonly resulting from inconsistency between the guidance and target images. Of
                    particular relevance, the proposed model demonstrates much better robustness than competing deep
                    models in a range of noisy scenarios.</p>

                  <strong>Title:</strong> Coupled Dictionary Learning for Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction<br>
                  <strong>Authors:</strong> P. Song, L. Weizmann, J. M. C. Mota, Y. Eldar, and M. R. D. Rodrigues<br>
                  <strong>Journal/Conference:</strong> IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging<br>
                  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging tasks often involve multiple contrasts,
                    such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) data. These
                    contrasts
                    capture information associated with the same underlying anatomy and thus exhibit similarities in
                    either structure level or gray level. In this paper, we propose a Coupled Dictionary Learning based
                    multi-contrast MRI reconstruction (CDLMRI) approach to leverage the dependency correlation between
                    different contrasts for guided or joint reconstruction from their under-sampled k-space data. Our
                    approach iterates between three stages: coupled dictionary learning, coupled sparse denoising, and
                    enforcing k-space consistency. The first stage learns a set of dictionaries that not only are
                    adaptive
                    to the contrasts, but also capture correlations among multiple contrasts in a sparse transform
                    domain.
                    By capitalizing on the learned dictionaries, the second stage performs coupled sparse coding to
                    remove
                    the aliasing and noise in the corrupted contrasts. The third stage enforces consistency between the
                    denoised contrasts and the measurements in the k-space domain. Numerical experiments, consisting of
                    retrospective under-sampling of various MRI contrasts with a variety of sampling schemes,
                    demonstrate
                    that CDLMRI is capable of capturing structural dependencies between different contrasts. The learned
                    priors indicate notable advantages in multi-contrast MR imaging and promising applications in
                    quantitative MR imaging such as MR fingerprinting.</p>

                  <strong>Title:</strong> Hardware-Limited Task-Based Quantization<br>
                  <strong>Authors:</strong> N. Shlezinger, Y. C. Eldar, and M. R. D. Rodrigues<br>
                  <strong>Journal/Conference:</strong> IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing<br>
                  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantization plays a critical role in digital signal processing
                    systems.
                    Quantizers are typically
                    designed to obtain an accurate digital representation of the input signal, operating independently
                    of
                    the system task, and are commonly implemented using serial scalar analog-to-digital converters
                    (ADCs).
                    In this work, we study hardware-limited task-based quantization, where a system utilizing a serial
                    scalar
                    ADC is designed to provide a suitable representation in order to allow the recovery of a parameter
                    vector
                    underlying the input signal. We propose hardware-limited task-based quantization systems for a fixed
                    and
                    finite quantization resolution, and characterize their achievable distortion. We then apply the
                    analysis to
                    the practical setups of channel estimation and eigen-spectrum recovery from quantized measurements.
                    Our
                    results illustrate that properly designed hardware-limited systems can approach the optimal
                    performance
                    achievable with vector quantizers, and that by taking the underlying task into account, the
                    quantization
                    error can be made negligible with a relatively small number of bits.</p>

                  <strong>Title:</strong> Asymptotic Task-Based Quantization with Application to Massive MIMO<br>
                  <strong>Authors:</strong> N. Shlezinger, Y. C. Eldar, and M. R. D. Rodrigues<br>
                  <strong>Journal/Conference:</strong> IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing<br>
                  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantizers take part in nearly every digital signal
                    processing system which operates on physical signals. They are
                    commonly designed to accurately represent the underlying signal,
                    regardless of the specific task to be performed on the quantized
                    data. In systems working with high-dimensional signals, such
                    as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, it is
                    beneficial to utilize low-resolution quantizers, due to cost, power,
                    and memory constraints. In this work we study quantization of
                    high-dimensional inputs, aiming at improving performance under
                    resolution constraints by accounting for the system task in the
                    quantizers design. We focus on the task of recovering a desired signal statistically related to the
                    high-dimensional input, and analyze
                    two quantization approaches: We first consider vector quantization, which is typically
                    computationally
                    infeasible, and characterize
                    the optimal performance achievable with this approach. Next, we
                    focus on practical systems which utilize hardware-limited scalar
                    uniform analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and design a taskbased quantizer under this model. The
                    resulting system accounts
                    for the task by linearly combining the observed signal into a lower
                    dimension prior to quantization. We then apply our proposed
                    technique to channel estimation in massive MIMO networks. Our
                    results demonstrate that a system utilizing low-resolution scalar
                    ADCs can approach the optimal channel estimation performance
                    by properly accounting for the task in the system design.</p>

                  <strong>Title:</strong>Compressive sensing with side information: How to optimally capture this extra
                  information for GMM signals?<br>

                  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies how to optimally capture side information to aid in
                    the reconstruction of high-dimensional signals from low-dimensional random linear and noisy
                    measurements, by assuming that both the signal of interest and the side information signal are drawn
                    from a joint Gaussian mixture model. In particular, we derive sufficient and (occasionally)
                    necessary conditions on the number of linear measurements for the signal reconstruction minimum mean
                    squared error (MMSE) to approach zero in the low-noise regime; moreover, we also derive closed-form
                    linear side information measurement designs for the reconstruction MMSE to approach zero in the
                    low-noise regime. Our designs suggest that a linear projection kernel that optimally captures side
                    information is such that it measures the attributes of side information that are maximally
                    correlated with the signal of interest. A number of experiments both with synthetic and real data
                    confirm that our theoretical results are well aligned with numerical ones. Finally, we offer a case
                    study associated with a panchromatic sharpening (pan sharpening) application in the presence of
                    compressive hyperspectral data that demonstrates that our proposed linear side information
                    measurement designs can lead to reconstruction peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gains in excess of
                    2 dB over other approaches in this practical application.</p>
